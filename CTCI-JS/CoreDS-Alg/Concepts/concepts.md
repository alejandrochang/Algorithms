# Must Know Concepts for Interviews

1. Bit Manipulation
JS uses 32 bits Bitwise Operands. (Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR and Bitwise XOR)

- Bitwise AND: When a bitwise AND is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1.
Ex:
0 & 0 -> 0
1 & 0 -> 0
0 & 1 -> 0
1 & 1 -> 1

- Bitwise OR: When a bitwise OR is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if one of the bits is 1.
Ex.
0 | 0	-> 0
0 | 1	-> 1 
1 | 0	-> 1
1 | 1	-> 1

- Bitwise XOR: When a bitwise XOR is performed on bits, it returns 1 if the bits are different.
Ex.
0 ^ 0	-> 0
0 ^ 1	-> 1 
1 ^ 0	-> 1
1 ^ 1	-> 0 


2. Memory (Stack vs. Heap)


3. Recursion

4. Dynamic Programming
DP is a technique used for solving complex operations by dividing them into various smaller problems, and solving each of them only once.

5. Big O Time & Space Complexity
