# Trees and Graphs 

### Trees
A tree is made up of Nodes with 0, 1 to several different pointers to other Nodes. Each Node has 
children that is an array with all of that nodes children and so forth. 

1. Parent - A node that points to other nodes is the parent of those nodes. Every node except the root has one parent. 
2. Child - A node is the child of any node that points to it. 
3. Parent - All the nodes that can be reached by following a path of child nodes from a particular node are the descendents of that node. 
4. Ancestor - An ancestor of a node is any other node for which the node is a descendant. 
5. Leaves - The leaves are nodes that do not have any children.
