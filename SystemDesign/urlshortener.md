# Question: Design a service like tinyURL, a URL shortening service, a web service that provides short aliases for redirection of long URLs:

Goals:
Basically we need a one to one mapping to get a shorten URL which can retrieve the original URL later. This will involve saving such data into a database. 

Things we should consider:
1. What's the trafiic volume / length of the shortened URL?
2. What's the mapping function?
3. Single Machine or Multiple Machines?

Traffic: Let's assume we want to serve more than 1000 billion URLs. If we can use 62 characters [A-Z, a-z, 0-9] for the short URLs having length n, then we can have total 62^n URLs. So, we should keep our URLs as short as possible given that it should fulfill the requirement. For our requirement, we should use n=7 i.e the length of short URLs will be 7 and we can serve 62^7 ~= 3500 billion URLs.

Basic solution:

To make things easier, we can assume the alias is something like http://tinyurl.com/<alias_hash> and alias_hash is a fixed length string.
To begin with, let’s store all the mappings in a single database. A straightforward approach is using alias_hash as the ID of each mapping, which can be generated as a random string of length 7.

Therefore, we can first just store <ID, URL>. When a user inputs a long URL “http://www.google.com”, the system creates a random 7-character string like “abcd123” as ID and inserts entry <“abcd123”, “http://www.google.com”> into the database.

In the run time, when someone visits http://tinyurl.com/abcd123, we look up by ID “abcd123” and redirect to the corresponding URL “http://www.google.com”.

Problem with this solution:
We can't generate unique hash values for the given long URL. In hashing, there may be collisions (2 long urls map to same short url) and we need a unique short url for every long url so that we can access long url back but hash is one way function.

Better Solution:

One of the most simple but also effective one, is to have a database table set up this way:

Table Tiny_Url(
ID : int PRIMARY_KEY AUTO_INC,
Original_url : varchar,
Short_url : varchar
)

Then the auto-incremental primary key ID is used to do the conversion: (ID, 10) <==> (short_url, BASE). Whenever you insert a new original_url, the query can return the new inserted ID, and use it to derive the short_url, save this short_url and send it to cilent.

  
 
Multiple machines:

If we are dealing with massive data of our service, distributed storage can increase our capacity. The idea is simple, get a hash code from original URL and go to corresponding machine then use the same process as a single machine. For routing to the correct node in cluster, Consistent Hashing is commonly used.
