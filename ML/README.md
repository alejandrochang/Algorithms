# Machine Learning

Problem Solving Process
1. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
3. Decide on the type of output you're predicting
4. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a coorelation between your 'features' and 'labels'
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make prediction


## Data
Getting and gathering the data is pretty important to have a good estimate of what our hypothesis can be for the future. 

Output Examples:
Classification -> The value of our labels belong to a discrete set
Regression -> The value of our labels belong to a continous set
