Problem Solving Process
1. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
2. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
3. Decide on the type of output you're predicting
4. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a coorelation between your 'features' and 'labels'
5. Use model generated by algorithm to make prediction
