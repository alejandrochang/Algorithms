// URLify

// Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
// has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the
// "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that 
// you can perform this operation in place);


const urlify = (str) => {

}

console.log(urlify('hello world')); // 'hello%20world'
console.log(urlify('that how it works !   ')); // 'that%20how%20it%20works%20!'
