// Sort Stack:
// Write a program to sort a stack such that smallest items are on the top
// and largest are at bottom. You can use a temp stack but may not copy elements
// into another structure such as an array. The stack supports these operations:
// push, pop, peek, isEmpty

class sortStack {
  constructor() {
    this.data = [];
  }
